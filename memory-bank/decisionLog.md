| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 15:42     | Start analysis by reading `frmMain.cs`.                                  | `frmMain.cs` typically handles UI and application entry point/main loop, providing a good overview of user interaction and program flow. | Reading `Program.cs` (usually minimal). | Confirmed UI structure, main simulation loop, and references to `Yacht` and `Computer` classes.                 |
| 15:42     | Next, read `Yacht.cs`.                                                   | Referenced by `frmMain.cs` and likely contains core game logic.                                                                      | Reading `Computer.cs` first.          | Understood game rules, dice mechanics, scoring, and how it interacts with a `Computer` object for AI moves.     |
| 15:42     | Next, read `Computer.cs`.                                                | Referenced by `Yacht.cs` and `frmMain.cs`; expected to contain AI decision-making logic.                                             | Reading utility classes like `Dice.cs`. | Revealed complex AI strategy involving weighted choices for holding dice and selecting scoring categories.      |
| 15:43     | Next, read `Dice.cs`.                                                    | Referenced by `Computer.cs` for probability calculations (`CalculateExactChance`).                                                   | Skipping less central files.          | Understood the dice probability calculation method (exhaustive enumeration).                                  |
| 15:43     | Defer analysis of `ComputerTester.cs`, `YachtTest.cs`, `TransmutableComputer.cs`. | These seem like testing or auxiliary classes, not central to the core functionality requested by the user task.                  | Analyzing all `.cs` files.            | Focused on core logic for initial summary and pseudocode. These files can be analyzed later if more depth is needed. |
| 15:43     | Proceed to generate functional overview and pseudocode.                  | Sufficient understanding of core modules (`frmMain`, `Yacht`, `Computer`, `Dice`) has been achieved.                                 | Further detailed file analysis.       | Able to produce the requested deliverables.                                                                   |
| 15:43     | Create Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, etc.). | Task requirement to store analysis in Memory Bank. Files were missing.                                                               | Inform user and stop.                 | Memory Bank populated with analysis results.                                                                  |
| 15:46     | Create `architecture.md` to document the software architecture. | User request to describe software architecture based on existing Memory Bank analysis. | - | Provided a structured overview of the system's architecture, components, and interactions. |
| 16:00     | Implement manual single-step (full game) simulation.                     | User requirement to change from automated continuous simulation to manual per-game simulation.                                       | Modifying timer for slower steps; adding more granular pause/play. | `frmMain.cs` timer removed. New button `btnManualStep` added. Logic in `btnManualStep_Click` now runs one full game. UI updates dice, scores, and stats. Memory Bank docs updated. |
---
### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-18 16:05:00] - Implemented manual simulation logic in `btnManualStep_Click`

**Rationale:**
The user requested a manual, full-game simulation per button click. The logic iterates `yYacht.ComputerNextMove()` until a game completes, then updates statistics and resets the game. UI updates for dice and scores are performed after each turn within the game loop for better user feedback, and final stats are updated upon game completion. This approach directly addresses the requirements and reuses existing game logic and statistical update mechanisms.

**Details:**
- Modified: [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) (added `btnManualStep_Click` handler)
- Modified: [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0) (added `btnManualStep` control and event wiring)
- Removed timer-based simulation (`tmrMain`, `tmrMain_Tick`) and pause functionality (`btnPause`).
17 | ---
18 | | (Timestamp from env) | Refine "Manual Single Step Simulation" to be step-by-step within a turn. | User clarified that "manual single step" should mean one step within a turn (roll, AI hold, AI score) rather than one full game. | Keep existing full-game step; Add a new button for finer-grained steps. | Chosen approach modifies existing button's behavior for clarity and directness. Requires significant refactoring of `ComputerNextMove` and state management in `frmMain.cs`. |
19 | | (Timestamp from env) | Decompose `Computer.cs` AI logic and `Yacht.cs` game flow. | To allow `frmMain.cs` to control each step of a turn, the monolithic `ComputerNextMove()` (or equivalent) logic needs to be broken into smaller, publicly callable methods. | Expose internal state variables from `Yacht.cs`/`Computer.cs` for `frmMain.cs` to manipulate (more complex, breaks encapsulation). | New methods proposed: `Computer.ComputerDecideDiceToHold()`, `Computer.ComputerSelectScoringCategory()`, `Yacht.PerformRoll()`, `Yacht.ApplyHoldDecision()`, `Yacht.ApplyScoreAndFinalizeTurn()`. |
20 | | (Timestamp from env) | Introduce `TurnStepPhase` state enumeration in `frmMain.cs`. | To manage the sequence of operations within a single turn when "手动单步模拟" button is clicked. Each click advances to the next phase. | Using multiple boolean flags (less clear, harder to manage); Using integer state codes. | `TurnStepPhase` enum (e.g., `READY_FOR_ROLL_1`, `AWAITING_HOLD_DECISION_1`, etc.) provides a clear and manageable way to control the step-through logic in `btnManualStep_Click`. |

### Decision (Architecture Review)
[2025-05-18 16:24:59] - Confirmed `architecture.md` accurately reflects step-through simulation changes.

**Rationale:**
The `spec-pseudocode` mode previously updated `architecture.md` to detail the new `TurnStepPhase` in `frmMain.cs`, the refined public interfaces of `Yacht.cs` and `Computer.cs`, and the updated control/data flow for the "手动单步模拟" feature. This review by Architect mode confirms these descriptions are accurate and align with the refined requirements for step-by-step turn execution. Minor textual adjustments were made for clarity and to update the review timestamp.

**Implications/Details:**
- `architecture.md` is now considered up-to-date regarding the manual step-through simulation logic.
- This confirmation allows other modes or future development to confidently use `architecture.md` as a reference for this feature.
- Files updated: [`memory-bank/architecture.md`](memory-bank/architecture.md:0) (minor review edits), [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md:0), [`memory-bank/decisionLog.md`](memory-bank/decisionLog.md:0) (this entry), [`memory-bank/progress.md`](memory-bank/progress.md:0).

### Decision (Debug)
[2025-05-18 17:04:55] - [Bug Fix Strategy: Remove Invalid CDATA Tags]

**Rationale:**
Compilation errors CS1525 and CS1022 in `Computer.cs` and `Yacht.cs` indicated invalid characters at the beginning and end of the files. `read_file` confirmed the presence of `<![CDATA[` at the start and `]]>` at the end of both files. These tags are not valid C# syntax and were causing the compilation to fail. The most direct fix was to remove these tags.

**Details:**
- Affected components/files: [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0), [`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`](ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs:0)
- Action: Used `write_to_file` tool to rewrite both files without the offending CDATA tags. This was chosen after `apply_diff` and `search_and_replace` tools encountered persistent issues with either diff formatting or locating the exact strings at the file boundaries. `write_to_file` provided a more robust way to ensure the files were correctly formatted.

### Decision (Debug)
[2025-05-18 18:47:00] - [Bug Fix Strategy: Address Compilation Errors and Warnings]

**Rationale:**
The primary goal was to resolve compilation errors CS0426 and CS1061 reported in the build log to allow the project to compile successfully. Secondary goal was to address warnings CS0108 and CS0618 where feasible without major refactoring.

**Details:**
*   **CS0426 (Error in `frmMain.cs`):**
    *   **Issue:** `ScoringDecision` was incorrectly referenced as `Computer.ScoringDecision`.
    *   **Fix:** Changed `Computer.ScoringDecision` to `ScoringDecision` in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:266) as `ScoringDecision` is defined in the `ComputerYacht` namespace, not within the `Computer` class.
*   **CS1061 (Error in `Computer.cs`):**
    *   **Issue:** `Yacht` object was called with a non-existent method `GetDicesValue`.
    *   **Fix:** Replaced calls to `yYacht.GetDicesValue(i)` with `yYacht.GetCurrentDiceValues()[i]` in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:663) and [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:677), as `GetCurrentDiceValues()` is the correct method returning an array.
*   **CS0108 (Warning in `YachtTest.cs`):**
    *   **Issue:** Methods `PlayerToString` and `DicesToString` in `YachtTest` were hiding base class members.
    *   **Fix:** Added the `new` keyword to `PlayerToString` and `DicesToString` method signatures in [`ComputerYacht/YachtTest.cs`](ComputerYacht/YachtTest.cs:0).
*   **CS0618 (Warning in `frmMain.cs`):**
    *   **Issue:** Obsolete method `Yacht.ComputerNextMove()` was called in the `Next()` method.
    *   **Fix:** Commented out the entire `Next()` method in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) as it appeared to be unused by the current step-through simulation logic.
*   **CS0618 (Warning in `TransmutableComputer.cs`):**
    *   **Decision:** Deferred, as `TransmutableComputer.cs` is likely not part of the core compilation path for the main application and fixing it might involve more complex refactoring outside the immediate scope of fixing primary compilation errors.

### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-18 19:10:00] - AI Logic Porting Strategy for `Computer.cs`

**Rationale:**
The task was to port the old, complex AI logic from obsolete methods (`HoldDice`, `GetScoringLocation`) into the new `DecideDiceToHold` and `ChooseScoreCategory` methods in `Computer.cs`.

*   **For `ChooseScoreCategory`:** The logic from the old `GetBestScoreIndex` (and its helpers like `GetDiceScoreBalance`, `ViableBonusScore`) was deemed adaptable. The approach was to refactor these to work with parameters (`finalDiceValues`, `availableCategories`) instead of direct `Yacht` object access. A new helper `IsBonusStillViableInternal` was created to encapsulate parts of `ViableBonusScore`'s logic. The existing `CalculateScoreForCategory` was enhanced to better handle Joker rules for Yachtzee scoring. This provides a significant improvement over the placeholder.

*   **For `DecideDiceToHold`:** The original logic (primarily `CalculateBestScoreItem` -> `HoldDiceForScore` -> `HoldSpecificDice` and complex chance calculations) was found to be deeply intertwined with the `Yacht` object's state. Methods like `HoldSpecificDice` directly modified `yYacht.DicesHold`, and chance calculations relied on this state. A full, direct port to a stateless, parameter-driven model would require extensive refactoring of many helper methods and careful simulation of state changes, which is a very complex and error-prone task.
    Given the complexity and the risk of introducing subtle bugs, the decision was made to:
    1.  Retain the simpler placeholder logic for `DecideDiceToHold` for now.
    2.  Add extensive comments within `DecideDiceToHold` detailing:
        *   The structure and key components of the original AI's dice-holding strategy.
        *   The specific challenges related to state dependency and the refactoring required for methods like `HoldSpecificDice`, `CalculateChance`, and `CalculateBestScoreItem`.
        *   A high-level outline of how a more complete port could be approached in the future.
    This approach fulfills the task requirement of documenting difficulties if a direct port is too complex, while still delivering improvements to `ChooseScoreCategory`.

**Details:**
- Modified: [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
    - `ChooseScoreCategory` reimplemented with ported logic.
    - `IsBonusStillViableInternal` helper added.
    - `CalculateScoreForCategory` enhanced for Joker rules.
    - `DecideDiceToHold` kept placeholder logic but with extensive new comments explaining porting challenges of old AI.
- Tools: Used `write_to_file` for `Computer.cs` after encountering persistent issues with `apply_diff` on complex multi-method replacements.

### Decision (Debug)
[2025-05-18 19:31:35] - [Bug Fix Strategy: Remove Invalid CDATA Tags from Computer.cs]

**Rationale:**
The compilation log showed multiple errors (CS1525, CS1003, CS1002, CS1529, CS1022, CS8803, CS1733) pointing to invalid syntax at the beginning and end of `ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`. Inspection confirmed the presence of `<![CDATA[` at the start and `]]>` at the end of the file. These tags are not valid C# syntax and were the root cause of the compilation failure. The most direct fix was to remove these tags. This is consistent with previous similar issues in other files.

**Details:**
- Affected components/files: [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
- Action: Used the `write_to_file` tool to rewrite the file, removing `<![CDATA[` from the first line and `]]>` from the last line. The `write_to_file` tool was chosen for its robustness in handling file boundary modifications, based on past experiences documented in the Memory Bank.
---
### Decision (Debug)
[2025-05-18 20:13:00] - [Bug Fix Strategy: Define NUM_CATEGORIES constant]

**Rationale:**
Compilation error CS0117 indicated that `Yacht.NUM_CATEGORIES` was undefined. The `Computer.cs` file uses this to iterate through scoring categories. The most direct fix is to define this constant in the `Yacht` class. The value 13 is confirmed by `productContext.md` (line 20: "13 standard scoring categories").

**Details:**
- Affected components/files: [`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`](ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs:0), [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0) (indirectly, by resolving its dependency)
- Action: Added `public const int NUM_CATEGORIES = 13;` to the `Yacht` class in [`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`](ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs:607).

### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-18 20:38:00] - Implemented a new heuristic-based dice holding strategy in `Computer.cs`'s `DecideDiceToHold` method.

**Rationale:**
The previous placeholder logic for `DecideDiceToHold` was too simplistic, causing the AI to underperform. The new strategy uses a series of prioritized rules (checking for Yachtzee, Four of a Kind, Full House, Straights, Three of a Kind, Pairs, and high dice) to make more intelligent decisions about which dice to hold across rolls 1 and 2. This aims to significantly improve AI gameplay by better pursuing valuable combinations. Full porting of the original complex AI was deemed too complex for this task, so a rule-based heuristic was chosen as a significant improvement.

**Details:**
- Modified: [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0) (updated `DecideDiceToHold` and added helper methods like `CountOccurrences`, `HasNOfAKind`, `IsSmallStraight`, `IsLargeStraight`, `MarkStraightDice`, `HoldValue`, `GetSortedUniqueDice`, `CountHeld`).

### Decision (Debug)
[2025-05-18 20:43:34] - [Bug Fix Strategy: Remove Invalid CDATA Tags from Computer.cs]

**Rationale:**
The compilation log showed multiple errors (CS1525, CS1003, CS1002, CS1529, CS1022, CS8803, CS1733) pointing to invalid syntax at the beginning and end of `ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`. Inspection confirmed the presence of `<![CDATA[` at the start and `]]>` at the end of the file. These tags are not valid C# syntax and were the root cause of the compilation failure. The most direct fix was to remove these tags. This is consistent with previous similar issues in other files and user instruction.

**Details:**
- Affected components/files: [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
- Action: Used the `write_to_file` tool to rewrite the file, removing `<![CDATA[` from the first line and `]]>` from the last line.

### Decision (Architecture Update)
[2025-05-18 21:14:00] - 更新架构文档以包含手动骰子输入和AI建议功能。

**Rationale:**
响应用户提出的新功能需求（允许用户手动输入5个骰子点数，然后应用基于这些点数提供 AI 的保留建议），并确保架构文档准确反映预期的系统行为和组件交互。`spec-pseudocode` 模式已为此功能生成了规范和伪代码，这些信息也为本次架构更新提供了依据。

**Implications/Details:**
- [`memory-bank/architecture.md`](memory-bank/architecture.md:0) 已更新，主要修改包括：
    - 在概述中加入了新功能的描述。
    - 更新了对 [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) 的描述，说明了新增的UI元素（5个骰子输入框，1个建议按钮）及其事件处理流程。
    - 更新了对 [`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`](ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs:0) 的描述，加入了新的公共方法 `SetManuallyEnteredDice()` 用于接收手动输入的骰子。
    - 更新了对 [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0) 的描述，说明其 `DecideDiceToHold()` 方法将如何处理来自手动设置的骰子。
    - 新增了一个专门描述此功能数据流和控制流的子章节，并包含了一个Mermaid序列图。
    - 更新了文档的总结部分。
- 此更新为后续开发和模式（如 `code` 模式）实现此功能提供了清晰的架构指导。

### Decision (Code Implementation)
[2025-05-18 21:22:00] - Tooling Choice: `write_to_file` over `apply_diff` for complex/multi-part file modifications.

**Rationale:**
During the implementation of the "Manual Dice Input & AI Suggestion" feature, multiple attempts to use `apply_diff` for modifications to [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0) and [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) failed due to persistent "Diff block is malformed: marker '=======' found in your diff content" errors. Despite several attempts to correct the diff format, the issue persisted, likely due to the complexity of the changes involving multiple insertion points and renamings.

To ensure reliable and timely completion of the file modifications, the strategy was switched to using `read_file` to get the current content, manually constructing the complete desired file content in memory, and then using `write_to_file` to overwrite the target file.

**Details:**
- Affected files: [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0), [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0).
- Alternative considered: Continued attempts to debug `apply_diff` formatting, breaking down diffs into smaller pieces.
- Outcome: Using `write_to_file` proved successful and allowed the task to proceed efficiently. While `apply_diff` is preferred for surgical changes, `write_to_file` is a more robust fallback for complex or problematic diffs.

### Decision (Debug)
[2025-05-18 21:29:02] - [Bug Fix Strategy: Remove Invalid CDATA Tags from Multiple Files]

**Rationale:**
The compilation log showed multiple errors (CS1519, CS1525, CS1003, CS1001, CS1002, CS1529) pointing to invalid syntax at the beginning and/or end of `ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`, `ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`, and `ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`. Inspection of these files (and similar issues in Memory Bank files) confirmed the presence of `<![CDATA[` at the start and `]]>` at the end of these code files. These tags are not valid C# syntax and were the root cause of the compilation failures. The most direct and previously successful fix strategy for such issues is to remove these tags.

**Details:**
- Affected components/files: [`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`](ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs:0), [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0), [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)
- Action: Used the `write_to_file` tool to rewrite each file, removing the `<![CDATA[` and `]]>` tags from their respective beginnings and endings. The `write_to_file` tool was chosen for its robustness in handling file boundary modifications, consistent with past successful interventions documented in the Memory Bank.

### Decision (Specification & Pseudocode)
[2025-05-18 22:15:00] - Enhance Manual Dice Input AI Suggestion with Roll Number and Upper Score Context

**Rationale:**
User feedback indicated that the AI's hold suggestions for manually entered dice were suboptimal due to a lack of game context (current roll number, scores). To address this, the feature will be enhanced to allow users to input the current roll number (1, 2, or 3) and their current upper section score. The AI's `DecideDiceToHold` method will be updated to use this additional information for more intelligent decision-making.

**Details:**
*   **UI Enhancements ([`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)):**
    *   A `ComboBox` (or `NumericUpDown`), named `cmbRollNumber`, will be added for the user to specify the current roll number.
    *   A `TextBox`, named `txtCurrentUpperScore`, will be added for the user to input their current total score for the upper section.
*   **Logic Modifications:**
    *   [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0): The `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` event handler will be modified to:
        *   Read the selected `rollNumber` from `cmbRollNumber`.
        *   Read the `currentUpperScore` from `txtCurrentUpperScore`.
        *   Pass these, along with `currentDiceValues` and `availableCategories`, to `compPlayer.DecideDiceToHold()`.
    *   [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0): The `DecideDiceToHold` method signature will be changed to `public bool[] DecideDiceToHold(int[] currentDiceValues, int rollNumber, bool[] availableCategories, int currentUpperScore)`. The internal heuristics will be updated to leverage `rollNumber` and `currentUpperScore` (e.g., to be more aggressive in pursuing upper section bonus if `currentUpperScore` is low and `rollNumber` is early).
*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   Attempting to have the AI infer these values (too complex and unreliable).
    *   Requiring full game state input (too cumbersome for the user for this specific feature, though could be a future enhancement).
*   **Outcome/Impact:**
    *   The AI's dice holding suggestions for manually entered dice will become significantly more context-aware and strategically sound.
    *   The UI will require users to provide two additional pieces of information.
    *   Pseudocode for these changes has been generated.
    *   Memory Bank documents (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `architecture.md`, `progress.md`) will be updated to reflect this new specification.

### Decision (Architecture Review)
[2025-05-18 22:22:00] - Confirmed `architecture.md` accurately reflects enhanced manual dice input AI suggestion (with roll number and upper score context).

**Rationale:**
The `spec-pseudocode` mode previously updated `architecture.md` (on 2025-05-18 22:15:00) to detail the new UI elements (`cmbRollNumber`, `txtCurrentUpperScore` in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)), the updated `DecideDiceToHold` method signature in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0) (now including `rollNumber` and `currentUpperScore`), and the corresponding data flow for the enhanced "manual dice input AI suggestion" feature. This review by Architect mode confirms these descriptions are accurate and align with the latest specifications.

**Implications/Details:**
- [`memory-bank/architecture.md`](memory-bank/architecture.md:0) is confirmed to be up-to-date regarding the enhanced manual dice input AI suggestion logic. No further changes were needed.
- This confirmation allows other modes or future development to confidently use [`memory-bank/architecture.md`](memory-bank/architecture.md:0) as a reference for this feature.
- Files updated: [`memory-bank/progress.md`](memory-bank/progress.md:0), [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md:0), [`memory-bank/decisionLog.md`](memory-bank/decisionLog.md:0) (this entry).

### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-18 22:25:00] - Enhanced Manual Dice Input AI Suggestion with Context (Implementation)

**Rationale:**
To implement the user's request for more context-aware AI suggestions, new UI elements for roll number and upper score were added. The AI's `DecideDiceToHold` method was modified to accept and utilize these new parameters. `frmMain.cs` was updated to gather these inputs and pass them to the AI, and to initialize the new UI elements.

**Details:**
*   **UI Changes ([`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0)):**
    *   Added `cmbRollNumber` (ComboBox) for selecting roll number (1-3).
    *   Added `txtCurrentUpperScore` (TextBox) for entering current upper section score.
    *   Added `lblRollNumber` and `lblCurrentUpperScore` labels for clarity.
    *   Adjusted layout of existing controls and form size to accommodate new elements.
*   **AI Logic Changes ([`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)):**
    *   Modified `DecideDiceToHold` signature to `public bool[] DecideDiceToHold(int[] currentDiceValues, int rollNumber, bool[] availableCategories, int currentUpperScore)`.
    *   Added logic: If `rollNumber` is 3, hold all dice.
    *   Added basic strategy: If aiming for upper bonus (`currentUpperScore < 63` and below a threshold like 45) and `rollNumber <= 2`, prioritize holding dice (2 or more of a kind, especially 4s, 5s, 6s) that contribute to available upper section categories. This is a preliminary heuristic.
*   **UI Logic Changes ([`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)):**
    *   In `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click`:
        *   Read `rollNumber` from `cmbRollNumber.SelectedItem`, parse to int, validate (1-3).
        *   Read `currentUpperScore` from `txtCurrentUpperScore.Text`, parse to int, validate (non-negative).
        *   Passed `rollNumber` and `currentUpperScore` to `compPlayer.DecideDiceToHold()`.
    *   In `InitializeNewGame()`:
        *   Set `cmbRollNumber.SelectedIndex = 0` (to default to "1").
        *   Set `txtCurrentUpperScore.Text = "0"`.
*   **Files Modified:**
    *   [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0)
    *   [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
    *   [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)

### Decision (Code - Bug Fix)
[2025-05-18 22:36:00] - Corrected AI logic for holding dice for straights.

**Rationale:**
The AI in `Computer.cs`'s `DecideDiceToHold` method was incorrectly suggesting to hold dice for Small Straights or Large Straights even when these scoring categories were already used by the player (i.e., `availableCategories` for these was `false`). This led to suboptimal AI play. The fix involves checking the `availableCategories` array for `Yacht.INDEX_SMLSTRAIGHT` and `Yacht.INDEX_LGESTRAIGHT` before attempting to hold dice for these combinations.

**Details:**
- Modified: [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
    - In `DecideDiceToHold`, added a condition `availableCategories[Yacht.INDEX_LGESTRAIGHT]` to the `if` statement that checks for large straights.
    - In `DecideDiceToHold`, added a condition `availableCategories[Yacht.INDEX_SMLSTRAIGHT]` to the `if` statement that checks for small straights.
- Tooling Choice: Used `write_to_file` to apply the changes after multiple `apply_diff` attempts failed due to formatting issues or perceived mismatches in the diff content. Read `Yacht.cs` to confirm correct constant names for straight categories.

---
### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-18 22:40:00] - Add Debug Logging to AI Straight Logic in `Computer.cs`

**Rationale:**
To diagnose why the AI might still be incorrectly holding dice for straights even when the category is unavailable (despite a previous fix), detailed logging is needed within the `DecideDiceToHold` method and its straight-related helper functions (`IsSmallStraight`, `IsLargeStraight`, `MarkStraightDice`). This logging will provide a clear trace of the AI's decision-making process, including parameter values, availability checks, and hold decisions.

**Details:**
- Modified: [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
    - Added `Console.WriteLine` statements at the entry of `DecideDiceToHold` to log `currentDiceValues`, `rollNumber`, `availableCategories` (specifically for straights), and `currentUpperScore`.
    - Added logging for dice counts after `CountOccurrences`.
    - Added logging before evaluating each major strategy (Yachtzee, 4K, FH, Straights, 3K, Pairs, High Dice, Default).
    - In the straight evaluation blocks:
        - Logged "Checking Large/Small Straight availability."
        - Logged the boolean value of `availableCategories[Yacht.INDEX_LGESTRAIGHT/SMLSTRAIGHT]`.
        - Logged "Skipping Large/Small Straight: Category not available." if applicable.
        - Logged "Large/Small Straight detected. Attempting to hold..." if applicable.
    - In `IsSmallStraight` and `IsLargeStraight`: Logged method entry and result.
    - In `MarkStraightDice`: Logged method entry with parameters, sorted unique dice, if a straight sequence is found, which dice are being held, and the final hold state.
    - Logged the `Final Hold Decision` array before returning from `DecideDiceToHold`.
    - Logged identified N-of-a-Kind combinations.
- Tooling Choice: Used `apply_diff` to inject logging statements.

### Decision (Debug)
[2025-05-18 22:48:00] - [Bug Fix Strategy: Correct Console.WriteLine and Initialize Field]

**Rationale:**
Addressed two distinct issues:
1.  CS1503 errors in `Computer.cs` caused by incorrect `Console.WriteLine` formatting for array types. The fix involved using `string.Join` as specified by the user for `diceCounts`.
2.  CS0649 warning in `frmMain.cs` due to the `currentPhase` field not being initialized. The fix involved initializing the field at its declaration.

**Details:**
- Affected components/files:
    - [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:58): Modified `Console.WriteLine` for `diceCounts`.
    - [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:25): Initialized `currentPhase` to `TurnStepPhase.READY_FOR_ROLL_1`.
---
### Decision (Debug)
[2025-05-18 22:55:13] - [Bug Fix Strategy: Address CS1061 and CS1503 in Computer.cs]

**Rationale:**
The compilation errors CS1061 (missing `Select` method for `int[]`) and CS1503 (array to string conversion) were preventing successful compilation.
CS1061 is typically resolved by adding `using System.Linq;`.
CS1503 errors in `Console.WriteLine` are resolved by ensuring array types are converted to strings using `string.Join()` or similar methods. Review of the current code showed `string.Join` was already in use for most reported lines, suggesting the CS1503 errors might be from an older build or a misinterpretation of the log against current code. The primary action is to add the Linq import.

**Details:**
- Affected components/files: [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
- Action for CS1061: Added `using System.Linq;` at the top of [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:2).
- Action for CS1503: Verified that `Console.WriteLine` calls involving arrays (specifically `currentDiceValues`, `diceToHold`, `diceCounts`) already use `string.Join()` or `Select()` with `string.Join()`. No direct changes for CS1503 were made as the `using System.Linq;` is expected to resolve the `Select` method for `diceCounts` and existing `string.Join` calls should cover other array printing.
---
### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-18 23:05:32] - Updated TargetFrameworkVersion to v4.0 and added System.Core reference in ComputerYacht.csproj

**Rationale:**
The project was failing to compile with a CS0234 error (System.Linq not found) because its TargetFrameworkVersion was v2.0, which does not support LINQ. Upgrading to v4.0 resolves this issue. System.Core.dll, which contains LINQ, is typically required for .NET 3.5+ and was added as a reference.

**Details:**
- Modified: [`ComputerYacht/ComputerYacht.csproj`](ComputerYacht/ComputerYacht.csproj:11) (TargetFrameworkVersion changed from v2.0 to v4.0)
- Added: [`ComputerYacht/ComputerYacht.csproj`](ComputerYacht/ComputerYacht.csproj:39) (Reference to System.Core added)

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-18 23:19:26
**Decision:** Implement manual control over AI's available scoring categories via UI checkboxes in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) for the "get hold suggestion" feature.
**Reasoning:**
*   Fulfills user request for more flexible testing of AI's retention suggestion capabilities.
*   Allows simulation of various game states where certain categories might be unavailable or strategically ignored.
*   Enhances user control over the AI testing process.
**Impacted Files:**
*   [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0): Addition of 13 `CheckBox` controls. Modification of `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` to read checkbox states and build `availableCategories` array. Modification of `InitializeNewGame` to reset checkbox states.
*   [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0): The `DecideDiceToHold` method's signature is already compatible as it accepts an `availableCategories` array. No code change required in this method itself.
*   [`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`](ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs:0): The `GetPlayerAvailableCategories()` method will no longer be used by the `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` event in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) for determining AI's available categories in this specific UI-driven flow.
**Alternatives Considered:** None, as this was a direct feature request for UI-based control.
**Follow-up Actions:** Proceed with implementation based on the generated pseudocode.

**Alternatives Considered:** 无，此为直接功能请求。
**Follow-up Actions:** 架构文档已更新。下一步将是代码模式根据此架构和相关伪代码实现功能。
---
### Decision (Architecture Review)
[2025-05-19 09:15:49] - 审查关于手动控制AI可用计分项的规范和伪代码。

**Rationale:**
用户提供了新的规范和伪代码，用于通过UI CheckBoxes手动控制AI在请求保留建议时可用的计分项。本次审查旨在确认现有架构文档 ([`memory-bank/architecture.md`](memory-bank/architecture.md:0)) 是否已准确反映这些变更，或者是否需要更新。

**Details:**
- 审查的变更包括在 [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0) 中添加13个CheckBox，以及在 [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) 的 `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` 方法中修改逻辑，以从这些CheckBoxes读取状态来构建 `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` 数组，并将其传递给 `compPlayer.DecideDiceToHold()`。同时，确认在此流程中不再调用 `yYacht.GetPlayerAvailableCategories(0)`。
- 经过核对，[`memory-bank/architecture.md`](memory-bank/architecture.md:0)（版本更新于 2025-05-18 23:22:00）已经详细并准确地记录了这些UI和逻辑变更及其对数据流的影响。
- 例如，文档中明确提到了新增的CheckBoxes、`availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` 的构建方式，以及不再调用 `Yacht.GetPlayerAvailableCategories()` 的情况。

### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-19 09:20:31] - Implemented UI CheckBoxes for Manual Category Control in AI Suggestions

**Rationale:**
To fulfill the user's requirement of allowing manual selection of available scoring categories for the AI's hold suggestion feature, UI CheckBoxes were added, and the logic in `frmMain.cs` was updated to use their states. This provides direct user control over one of the key inputs to the AI's `DecideDiceToHold` method.

**Details:**
*   **UI ([`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0)):**
    *   Added a `GroupBox` named `grpScoringCategories`.
    *   Added 13 `CheckBox` controls (e.g., `chkCatOnes`, `chkCatTwos`, ..., `chkCatChance`) within the `GroupBox`, corresponding to the 13 primary scoring categories.
    *   Adjusted form layout and `ClientSize` to accommodate these new controls.
*   **Logic ([`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)):**
    *   **`categoryCheckBoxes` Array:**
        *   A `private CheckBox[] categoryCheckBoxes;` member was added.
        *   A new method `InitializeCategoryCheckBoxArray()` was implemented. This method initializes `categoryCheckBoxes` as a `new CheckBox[13]` and assigns the designer-created `CheckBox` controls to this array in a specific order: Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes, ThreeOfAKind, FourOfAKind, FullHouse, SmStraight, LgStraight, Yachtzee, Chance. This order is crucial as it maps directly to the 0-12 indexed `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` boolean array passed to the AI.
        *   `InitializeCategoryCheckBoxArray()` is called in the `frmMain()` constructor immediately after `this.InitializeComponent();`.
    *   **`InitializeNewGame()`:**
        *   Modified to loop through the `categoryCheckBoxes` array and set `Checked = true` for each `CheckBox`. This ensures all categories are considered available by default at the start of a new game or when inputs are reset.
    *   **`btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click()`:**
        *   The line `bool[] availableCategories = yYacht.GetPlayerAvailableCategories(0);` was removed.
        *   A new boolean array `bool[] availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes = new bool[Yacht.NUM_CATEGORIES];` (where `Yacht.NUM_CATEGORIES` is 13) is created.
        *   A loop iterates from `i = 0` to `Yacht.NUM_CATEGORIES - 1`. Inside the loop, `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes[i]` is set to `categoryCheckBoxes[i].Checked`. This directly translates the user's UI selections into the boolean array format expected by the AI.
        *   The `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` array is then passed as the `availableCategories` argument to `compPlayer.DecideDiceToHold()`.
*   **Tooling Choice:**
    *   Used `write_to_file` for [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0) due to the extensive UI additions.
    *   Used `write_to_file` for [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) after an initial `apply_diff` attempt failed due to formatting issues, ensuring robust application of multiple logic changes and new method additions.

**Alternatives Considered for `availableCategories`:**
*   Using `Yacht.cs` index constants (e.g., `Yacht.INDEX_ONES`) to populate `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes`. This was considered but deemed slightly more complex to map correctly to a 0-12 indexed array if the constants themselves are not contiguous or include non-selectable items like `INDEX_TOPBONUS`. The direct sequential mapping from the `categoryCheckBoxes` array (which is ordered correctly) to the `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` array was chosen for simplicity and clarity, given that `Yacht.NUM_CATEGORIES` is confirmed to be 13.
---
### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-19 09:31:00] - Corrected invalid constant for Yachtzee index in frmMain.cs

**Rationale:**
The codebase was using `Yacht.INDEX_YACHTZEE` which was not defined in the `Yacht` class, leading to a compilation error (CS0117). The `Yacht` class defines the constant for the Yachtzee category as `Yacht.INDEX_YACHT`.

**Details:**
Changed `this.yYacht.GetPlayerScoreForCategory(0, Yacht.INDEX_YACHTZEE)`
to `this.yYacht.GetPlayerScoreForCategory(0, Yacht.INDEX_YACHT)`
in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:316).
---
### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-19 09:38:00] - Added debug logging for checkbox states in frmMain.cs

**Rationale:**
User reported a discrepancy between the UI checkbox states they believed were set (Large Straight checked) and the AI's behavior (Large Straight treated as unavailable based on previous logs). To help diagnose if the UI state is correctly read and passed to the AI, console logging was added to `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click`.

**Details:**
Inserted `Console.WriteLine` statements after the `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` array is populated in `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) (around [`line 272`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:272)). These logs will output the `Checked` property of `chkCatSmStraight` and `chkCatLgStraight` directly from the `categoryCheckBoxes` array, and their corresponding boolean values in the `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` array that is passed to the AI.
---
### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-19 10:14:00] - Enhanced debug logging in btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click method

**Rationale:**
User reported not seeing previously added debug logs for checkbox states, despite confirming they were running the latest code. To ensure the logging code is definitely present and to capture more context about the execution flow within `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click`, the entire method was replaced with a version containing more robust and comprehensive `Console.WriteLine` statements. This includes logging method entry/exit, input values, and detailed checks around the `categoryCheckBoxes` array and specific checkbox states.

**Details:**
The `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` method in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) was entirely replaced. The new version includes:
*   Entry log: `[DEBUG frmMain] btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click START`
*   Logs for parsed dice, roll number, upper score.
*   Logs for `categoryCheckBoxes` null status and length.
*   Logs for `chkCatSmStraight` and `chkCatLgStraight` UI `Checked` status and their corresponding values in `availableCategoriesFromCheckboxes`.
*   Log before calling `compPlayer.DecideDiceToHold` and after it returns.
*   Exit log: `[DEBUG frmMain] btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click END (Successful)`
*   Exception logging.
---
### Decision (Refactoring)
[2025-05-19 10:20:00] - Refactor `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` in `frmMain.cs` by extracting helper methods.

**Rationale:**
The `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` method in `ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs` had grown in complexity, handling UI input parsing (dice values, roll number, upper score), gathering available scoring categories from checkboxes, and then calling the AI logic. To improve readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns, the input parsing and category gathering logic was extracted into individual private helper methods.

**Details:**
*   **Affected File:** [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)
*   **New Helper Methods Created:**
    *   `private bool TryParseDiceInput(out int[] diceValues)`: Parses the five dice input TextBoxes, validates values (1-6), and returns a boolean indicating success and the parsed integer array.
    *   `private bool TryParseRollNumber(out int rollNumber)`: Parses the `cmbRollNumber` ComboBox, validates the selected roll number (1-3), and returns a boolean indicating success and the parsed integer.
    *   `private bool TryParseUpperScore(out int upperScore)`: Parses the `txtCurrentUpperScore` TextBox, validates the score (non-negative integer), and returns a boolean indicating success and the parsed integer.
    *   `private bool[] GetAvailableCategoriesFromCheckboxes()`: Iterates through the `categoryCheckBoxes` array, builds a boolean array representing the `Checked` state of each, and returns this array. Includes error handling for uninitialized or mismatched checkbox arrays.
*   **`btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` Modifications:**
    *   The method now calls each of the new helper methods in sequence.
    *   If any helper method indicates a parsing/validation failure (e.g., by returning `false` or `null`), `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` returns early, preventing further execution.
    *   The main `try-catch` block for calling the AI and updating UI remains in `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click`.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   The main event handler (`btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click`) is now significantly shorter and easier to understand, focusing on the overall workflow.
    *   Each specific piece of logic (dice parsing, roll number parsing, etc.) is encapsulated in its own method, making it easier to test, debug, and modify independently.
    *   Improved code organization and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle at a finer granularity.
---
### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-19 13:50:13] - Added Comprehensive Checkbox State Logging in `GetAvailableCategoriesFromCheckboxes`

**Rationale:**
The user reported that the UI checkbox states displayed in logs did not always match the actual UI, and requested more comprehensive logging to debug this. The existing logging in `GetAvailableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` in [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0) was limited to specific straight categories. To address this, a loop was added to iterate through all 13 `categoryCheckBoxes` and log each checkbox's `Name` (or its index if the name is unavailable) and its `Checked` status. This will provide a complete picture of the states being read from the UI just before they are used by the AI.

**Details:**
- Modified: [`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:331)
- Added a loop within `GetAvailableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` to iterate from `i = 0` to `Yacht.NUM_CATEGORIES - 1`.
- Inside the loop, `Console.WriteLine` now logs `categoryCheckBoxes[i].Name`, `i` (index), and `categoryCheckBoxes[i].Checked`.
- Added null checks for `categoryCheckBoxes[i]` within the loop for robustness.
- Added an initial `Console.WriteLine("[DEBUG frmMain] Checkbox States Before AI Call:")` header for clarity.
- Added a fallback log message if the `categoryCheckBoxes` array itself is null or has a mismatched length.
---
### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-19 14:36:00] - Enhanced Debug Logging for `availableCategories` Discrepancy

**Rationale:**
To diagnose an issue where `availableCategories[10]` (LgStraight) was reportedly `True` in `frmMain.cs` but `False` when received by `Computer.cs`'s `DecideDiceToHold` method, specific logging changes were made. The goal was to clearly track the state of this boolean array as it's passed between components.

**Details:**
*   **[`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0):** Removed an older, partial logging block within the `GetAvailableCategoriesFromCheckboxes` method (lines 308-329). This block was redundant with more comprehensive logging already added at the end of the same method (lines 331-349) which logs all 13 checkbox states.
*   **[`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:40):** Added a new logging block at the very beginning of the `DecideDiceToHold` method. This block iterates through the received `availableCategories` array and prints the name and boolean status of all 13 categories. This will show the exact state of the array as the AI method receives it.

**Alternatives Considered:**
*   Adding more intermediate logging points: Decided against this for now to first see the state at the entry point of the problematic method.
*   Using a debugger: While effective, adding direct logging provides a persistent record that can be reviewed alongside other application logs.

**Outcome/Impact:**
These changes will provide clearer insight into the state of the `availableCategories` array, specifically `availableCategories[10]`, at critical points, helping to pinpoint where the unexpected change from `True` to `False` might be occurring.

### Decision (Code - Debug)
[2025-05-19 14:52:34] - Corrected structural errors in `Computer.cs` to fix compilation issues.

**Rationale:**
The primary compilation errors in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0) (CS1002, CS1519, CS1031, etc.) stemmed from incorrect bracing within the `DecideDiceToHold` method. An opening brace `{` was missing after the method signature, and an extraneous `{` existed further down (original line 67).

**Details:**
- **Affected File:** [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
- **Action:**
    1. Added an opening brace `{` immediately after the `DecideDiceToHold` method signature (line 39).
    2. Removed the misplaced opening brace `{` from its original position (original line 67).
- **Tooling Choice:** Used `write_to_file` to apply these changes after multiple `apply_diff` attempts failed due to complexities in parsing multi-block diffs or internal diff markers. `write_to_file` provided a robust way to ensure the entire file was correctly structured with these fixes.
- **Expected Outcome:** Resolution of the majority of the reported compilation errors, particularly those related to invalid member declarations and syntax errors within the `DecideDiceToHold` method body. This should also resolve cascading errors like CS1022 (end-of-file expected).
]]>
---
### Decision (Code - Debug)
[2025-05-19 15:04:24] - Removed CDATA tags from Computer.cs to fix compilation errors.

**Rationale:**
The primary compilation errors (CS1002, CS1519, CS1031, CS1022, etc.) in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0) were determined to be caused by illegal `<![CDATA[` and `]]>` tags at the beginning and end of the file, respectively. These tags disrupt the C# compiler's parsing process. Removing them is essential for successful compilation.

**Details:**
- **Affected File:** [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)
- **Action:** Used `write_to_file` to remove `﻿<![CDATA[﻿` from the first line and `]]>` from the last line of the file. This approach was chosen after `apply_diff` failed due to issues with its internal diff markers.
- **Expected Outcome:** Resolution of compilation errors stemming from the CDATA tags, allowing the compiler to correctly parse the C# code.

### Decision (Code)
[2025-05-19 16:06:13] - Corrected scoring category index constants in Yacht.cs

**Rationale:**
The constants `INDEX_SMLSTRAIGHT`, `INDEX_LGESTRAIGHT`, `INDEX_YACHT`, and `INDEX_CHANCE` in `ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs` were found to be off-by-one, causing incorrect indexing into the `availableCategories` array. This led to bugs in AI decision-making for small and large straights. The constants were adjusted to their correct 0-based index values.

**Details:**
- Corrected `INDEX_SMLSTRAIGHT` from `10` to `9`.
- Corrected `INDEX_LGESTRAIGHT` from `11` to `10`.
- Corrected `INDEX_YACHT` from `12` to `11`.
- Corrected `INDEX_CHANCE` from `13` to `12`.
- File affected: [`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`](ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs:659-665)
