## Task: Implement Refined Step-Through Simulation (Phase 6 - Code Implementation)

**Overall Status:** COMPLETED
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-18 16:35:00 (Approximate time of completion)

### Sub-tasks (Phase 6):

1.  **Modify `ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Defined `TurnStepPhase` enum. Added `currentPhase` and other necessary member variables. Rewrote `btnManualStep_Click` to implement step-through logic based on `currentPhase`. Added `InitializeNewGame`, `UpdateStatusMessage`, `UpdateUI`, and `ProcessGameOver` methods. Ensured correct state initialization and reset.
2.  **Modify `ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Added `iCurrentTurnNumber`. Marked `ComputerNextMove` as Obsolete. Implemented `PerformRoll`, `ApplyHoldDecision`, `ApplyScoreAndFinalizeTurn`, `ResetForNewTurnIfNeeded`, and `ResetForNewGame`. Modified `ScoreValue` to accept pre-calculated scores. Added various getter methods (`GetCurrentDiceValues`, `GetCurrentHeldDice`, `GetRollAttemptInTurn`, `GetPlayerAvailableCategories`, `IsCategoryAvailable`, `GetPlayerScoreForCategory`, `IsGameOver` (no-arg), `GetCurrentTurnNumber`). Updated `DicesToString` and `PlayerToString`.
3.  **Modify `ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Defined `ScoringDecision` struct. Marked old `HoldDice` and `GetScoringLocation` as Obsolete. Implemented new public methods `DecideDiceToHold` and `ChooseScoreCategory` with placeholder/simplified AI logic. Added helper `CalculateScoreForCategory`. Full refactoring of complex internal AI logic to be parameter-based was deferred due to complexity but interfaces are in place.

**Summary of Completion (Phase 6):**
The C# code for `frmMain.cs`, `Yacht.cs`, and `Computer.cs` has been modified to implement the refined "Manual Single Step Simulation" feature. This allows users to step through each discrete action (roll, AI hold, AI score) within a computer player's turn. `frmMain.cs` now manages the turn phases, and `Yacht.cs` and `Computer.cs` provide the necessary fine-grained methods. The AI logic in `Computer.cs`'s new methods is currently simplified; a full port of the original complex AI strategy would require further significant refactoring of its internal methods.

## Task: Port Old AI Logic to New Computer Methods (Phase 9 - Implementation)

**Overall Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETED (ChooseScoreCategory ported, DecideDiceToHold placeholder with comments)
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-18 19:10:00

### Sub-tasks (Phase 9):

1.  **Analyze `Computer.cs` and old AI methods:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Reviewed `HoldDice`, `GetScoringLocation` and their numerous dependencies (`CalculateBestScoreItem`, `GetBestScoreIndex`, `HoldDiceForScore`, `HoldSpecificDice`, `CalculateChance`, etc.).
2.  **Port `GetScoringLocation` logic to `ChooseScoreCategory`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Adapted `GetBestScoreIndex` logic. Implemented `IsBonusStillViableInternal` as a helper. Updated `CalculateScoreForCategory` to better handle Joker rules for Yachtzee.
3.  **Address `DecideDiceToHold`:**
    *   Status: DEFERRED (Placeholder with detailed comments)
    *   Notes: Due to the high complexity of porting `CalculateBestScoreItem` and `HoldDiceForScore` (which heavily rely on internal `Yacht` state and complex interactions between helper methods like `HoldSpecificDice` and chance calculations), the existing placeholder logic in `DecideDiceToHold` was kept. Detailed comments were added to `DecideDiceToHold` explaining the original logic's structure, the challenges in porting it to a stateless method, and a potential approach for a more complete refactoring. This fulfills the requirement to document difficulties if a direct port is too complex.
4.  **Apply changes to `Computer.cs`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Used `write_to_file` to update `Computer.cs` with the new `ChooseScoreCategory` implementation and updated comments in `DecideDiceToHold`.

**Summary of Completion (Phase 9):**
The `ChooseScoreCategory` method in `Computer.cs` has been updated to incorporate the logic from the old AI's `GetBestScoreIndex` method, providing more intelligent category selection. The `DecideDiceToHold` method retains its placeholder logic due to the significant complexity of porting the original dice-holding strategy; however, extensive comments have been added to this method to guide future refactoring efforts. The AI should now make more strategic scoring decisions, though dice holding remains basic.

## Task: Fix Compilation Errors in Computer.cs (Phase 28 - Debugging)

**Overall Status:** COMPLETED
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-19 14:52:34

### Sub-tasks (Phase 28):

1.  **Analyze Compilation Log for `Computer.cs`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Identified multiple errors (CS1002, CS1519, CS1031, CS8124, CS1026, CS1022) primarily related to incorrect method body structure for `DecideDiceToHold`.
2.  **Inspect `Computer.cs` for Structural Issues:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Confirmed missing opening brace after `DecideDiceToHold` signature and a misplaced opening brace later in the code.
3.  **Fix Structural Issues in `Computer.cs`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
    *   Notes: Used `write_to_file` to add the correct opening brace after the `DecideDiceToHold` signature and remove the extraneous one.
4.  **Update Memory Bank - `activeContext.md`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
5.  **Update Memory Bank - `decisionLog.md`:**
    *   Status: COMPLETED
6.  **Update Memory Bank - `progress.md` (This update):**
    *   Status: COMPLETED

**Summary of Completion (Phase 28):**
Successfully fixed the primary structural compilation errors in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0) by correcting the bracing of the `DecideDiceToHold` method. This is expected to resolve a large number of the reported compiler errors. Memory Bank files have been updated to reflect this fix.
