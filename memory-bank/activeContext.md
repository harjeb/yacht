<![CDATA[# Active Context: Implemented Step-Through Simulation Feature

**Date:** 2025-05-18
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-18 16:36:00

## 1. Current Task & Focus

*   **Previous Task (Completed by Architect Mode):** Review and confirm `memory-bank/architecture.md` for step-through simulation changes.
*   **Current Task (Code Mode - COMPLETED):** Implement the refined "Manual Single Step Simulation" feature. This involved modifying `frmMain.cs`, `Yacht.cs`, and `Computer.cs` to allow step-by-step execution within a computer player's turn, based on the specifications and pseudocode in the Memory Bank.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Implementing `TurnStepPhase` state management in `frmMain.cs`.
    *   Refactoring `Yacht.cs` to provide fine-grained game operation methods and getters.
    *   Refactoring `Computer.cs` to provide fine-grained AI decision methods (`DecideDiceToHold`, `ChooseScoreCategory`) and defining `ScoringDecision`.
    *   Ensuring `frmMain.cs` correctly calls the new methods in `Yacht.cs` and `Computer.cs` to progress through turn phases.
    *   Updating Memory Bank (`progress.md`, this file) to reflect task completion.

## 2. Key Implementation Details

*   **`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`:**
    *   `TurnStepPhase` enum defined and `currentPhase` member added.
    *   `btnManualStep_Click` rewritten with a `switch` statement for phase-based actions.
    *   Helper methods `InitializeNewGame`, `ProcessGameOver`, `UpdateUI`, `UpdateStatusMessage` added.
    *   Calls new methods in `Yacht.cs` (e.g., `PerformRoll`, `ApplyHoldDecision`, `ApplyScoreAndFinalizeTurn`) and `Computer.cs` (e.g., `DecideDiceToHold`, `ChooseScoreCategory`).
*   **`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`:**
    *   `iCurrentTurnNumber` member added.
    *   `ComputerNextMove` marked `[Obsolete]`.
    *   New public methods: `PerformRoll`, `ApplyHoldDecision`, `ApplyScoreAndFinalizeTurn`, `ResetForNewGame`, `ResetForNewTurnIfNeeded`.
    *   `ScoreValue` modified to accept `preCalculatedScore`.
    *   Added various public getters: `GetCurrentDiceValues`, `GetCurrentHeldDice`, `GetRollAttemptInTurn`, `GetPlayerAvailableCategories`, `IsCategoryAvailable`, `GetPlayerScoreForCategory`, `IsGameOver` (no-arg), `GetCurrentTurnNumber`.
    *   `DicesToString` and `PlayerToString` updated for clarity.
*   **`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`:**
    *   `ScoringDecision` struct defined.
    *   Old `HoldDice` and `GetScoringLocation` marked `[Obsolete]`.
    *   New public methods `DecideDiceToHold` and `ChooseScoreCategory` implemented with **simplified/placeholder AI logic**. Full refactoring of the original complex AI strategy was not performed due to its deep coupling with the `Yacht` object state, but the required interfaces are now in place.
    *   Helper `CalculateScoreForCategory` added for internal score estimation in the placeholder logic.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps

*   **COMPLETED:** Code modifications for `frmMain.cs`, `Yacht.cs`, `Computer.cs`.
*   **COMPLETED:** Updated `memory-bank/progress.md`.
*   **COMPLETED:** Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file).
*   **PENDING:** Prepare `attempt_completion` to summarize the work.

## 4. Pending Questions or Blockers

*   The AI logic in `Computer.cs`'s new methods (`DecideDiceToHold`, `ChooseScoreCategory`) is currently a simplified placeholder. A full port of the original, more complex AI strategy would require significant further refactoring of `Computer.cs`'s internal helper methods to remove direct dependencies on the `Yacht` object's state, or a different approach to providing necessary game context to the AI.
*   UI elements (`lblStatusMessage`, `lblTurnInfo`) assumed in `frmMain.cs`'s `UpdateUI` and `UpdateStatusMessage` methods need to be added to `frmMain.Designer.cs` for visual feedback. Current implementation uses `Console.WriteLine` as a fallback.

## 5. Assumptions Made

*   The provided specifications and pseudocode in the Memory Bank were the primary guide for the refactoring.
*   The core requirement was to enable step-by-step execution flow, with the understanding that the AI's strategic depth in the refactored `Computer.cs` methods might initially be simplified.

    * Resolved CS1061 in `ComputerYacht/Computer.cs` by changing `yYacht.GetDicesValue(i)` to `yYacht.GetCurrentDiceValues()[i]`.
    * Addressed CS0108 warnings in `ComputerYacht/YachtTest.cs` by adding `new` keyword to `PlayerToString` and `DicesToString` methods.
    * Addressed CS0618 warning in `ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs` by commenting out the unused `Next()` method.

*   [2025-05-18 19:10:00] - [Code Update: AI Logic Porting]
    *   **Task:** Port old AI logic from obsolete methods in `Computer.cs` to new `DecideDiceToHold` and `ChooseScoreCategory` methods.
    *   **`ChooseScoreCategory`:** Successfully ported core logic from `GetBestScoreIndex`. This involved adapting the decision-making process for selecting the best scoring category based on final dice values and available categories. Helper method `IsBonusStillViableInternal` was added, and `CalculateScoreForCategory` was enhanced to correctly apply Joker rules related to Yachtzee.
    *   **`DecideDiceToHold`:** Due to high complexity and deep state dependency of the original `CalculateBestScoreItem` and `HoldDiceForScore` methods, a direct port was deferred. The existing placeholder logic in `DecideDiceToHold` remains. However, detailed comments have been added to this method, outlining:
        *   The structure of the original AI's dice holding strategy.
        *   The challenges in refactoring stateful helper methods (like `HoldSpecificDice`, `CalculateChance`) to work with parameterized state.
        *   A potential roadmap for a more complete port of this logic.
    *   **Outcome:** The AI's scoring decisions are now significantly more intelligent. Dice holding strategy remains basic but is clearly documented for future improvement. `Computer.cs` updated.
