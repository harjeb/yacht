<![CDATA[# Active Context: Implemented Step-Through Simulation Feature

**Date:** 2025-05-18
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-18 16:36:00

## 1. Current Task & Focus

*   **Previous Task (Completed by Architect Mode):** Review and confirm `memory-bank/architecture.md` for step-through simulation changes.
*   **Current Task (Code Mode - COMPLETED):** Implement the refined "Manual Single Step Simulation" feature. This involved modifying `frmMain.cs`, `Yacht.cs`, and `Computer.cs` to allow step-by-step execution within a computer player's turn, based on the specifications and pseudocode in the Memory Bank.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Implementing `TurnStepPhase` state management in `frmMain.cs`.
    *   Refactoring `Yacht.cs` to provide fine-grained game operation methods and getters.
    *   Refactoring `Computer.cs` to provide fine-grained AI decision methods (`DecideDiceToHold`, `ChooseScoreCategory`) and defining `ScoringDecision`.
    *   Ensuring `frmMain.cs` correctly calls the new methods in `Yacht.cs` and `Computer.cs` to progress through turn phases.
    *   Updating Memory Bank (`progress.md`, this file) to reflect task completion.

## 2. Key Implementation Details

*   **`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`:**
    *   `TurnStepPhase` enum defined and `currentPhase` member added.
    *   `btnManualStep_Click` rewritten with a `switch` statement for phase-based actions.
    *   Helper methods `InitializeNewGame`, `ProcessGameOver`, `UpdateUI`, `UpdateStatusMessage` added.
    *   Calls new methods in `Yacht.cs` (e.g., `PerformRoll`, `ApplyHoldDecision`, `ApplyScoreAndFinalizeTurn`) and `Computer.cs` (e.g., `DecideDiceToHold`, `ChooseScoreCategory`).
*   **`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`:**
    *   `iCurrentTurnNumber` member added.
    *   `ComputerNextMove` marked `[Obsolete]`.
    *   New public methods: `PerformRoll`, `ApplyHoldDecision`, `ApplyScoreAndFinalizeTurn`, `ResetForNewGame`, `ResetForNewTurnIfNeeded`.
    *   `ScoreValue` modified to accept `preCalculatedScore`.
    *   Added various public getters: `GetCurrentDiceValues`, `GetCurrentHeldDice`, `GetRollAttemptInTurn`, `GetPlayerAvailableCategories`, `IsCategoryAvailable`, `GetPlayerScoreForCategory`, `IsGameOver` (no-arg), `GetCurrentTurnNumber`.
    *   `DicesToString` and `PlayerToString` updated for clarity.
*   **`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`:**
    *   `ScoringDecision` struct defined.
    *   Old `HoldDice` and `GetScoringLocation` marked `[Obsolete]`.
    *   New public methods `DecideDiceToHold` and `ChooseScoreCategory` implemented with **simplified/placeholder AI logic**. Full refactoring of the original complex AI strategy was not performed due to its deep coupling with the `Yacht` object state, but the required interfaces are now in place.
    *   Helper `CalculateScoreForCategory` added for internal score estimation in the placeholder logic.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps

*   **COMPLETED:** Code modifications for `frmMain.cs`, `Yacht.cs`, `Computer.cs`.
*   **COMPLETED:** Updated `memory-bank/progress.md`.
*   **COMPLETED:** Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file).
*   **PENDING:** Prepare `attempt_completion` to summarize the work.

## 4. Pending Questions or Blockers

*   The AI logic in `Computer.cs`'s new methods (`DecideDiceToHold`, `ChooseScoreCategory`) is currently a simplified placeholder. A full port of the original, more complex AI strategy would require significant further refactoring of `Computer.cs`'s internal helper methods to remove direct dependencies on the `Yacht` object's state, or a different approach to providing necessary game context to the AI.
*   UI elements (`lblStatusMessage`, `lblTurnInfo`) assumed in `frmMain.cs`'s `UpdateUI` and `UpdateStatusMessage` methods need to be added to `frmMain.Designer.cs` for visual feedback. Current implementation uses `Console.WriteLine` as a fallback.

## 5. Assumptions Made

*   The provided specifications and pseudocode in the Memory Bank were the primary guide for the refactoring.
*   The core requirement was to enable step-by-step execution flow, with the understanding that the AI's strategic depth in the refactored `Computer.cs` methods might initially be simplified.

*   [2025-05-18 19:10:00] - [Code Update: AI Logic Porting]
    *   **Task:** Port old AI logic from obsolete methods in `Computer.cs` to new `DecideDiceToHold` and `ChooseScoreCategory` methods.
    *   **`ChooseScoreCategory`:** Successfully ported core logic from `GetBestScoreIndex`. This involved adapting the decision-making process for selecting the best scoring category based on final dice values and available categories. Helper method `IsBonusStillViableInternal` was added, and `CalculateScoreForCategory` was enhanced to correctly apply Joker rules related to Yachtzee.
    *   **`DecideDiceToHold`:** Due to high complexity and deep state dependency of the original `CalculateBestScoreItem` and `HoldDiceForScore` methods, a direct port was deferred. The existing placeholder logic in `DecideDiceToHold` remains. However, detailed comments have been added to this method, outlining:
        *   The structure of the original AI's dice holding strategy.
        *   The challenges in refactoring stateful helper methods (like `HoldSpecificDice`, `CalculateChance`) to work with parameterized state.
        *   A potential roadmap for a more complete port of this logic.
    *   **Outcome:** The AI's scoring decisions are now significantly more intelligent. Dice holding strategy remains basic but is clearly documented for future improvement. `Computer.cs` updated.

* [2025-05-18 21:28:43] - [Debug Status Update: Compilation Errors Fixed] Removed invalid CDATA tags from the beginning and end of `ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`, `ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`, and `ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs` to resolve CS1519, CS1525, CS1003, CS1001, CS1002, and CS1529 compilation errors.
* [2025-05-18 22:15:00] - [Spec-Pseudocode Task: Enhance Manual Dice Input AI Suggestion]
    *   **Task:** Define specifications and generate pseudocode to enhance the "manual dice input for AI hold suggestion" feature. The AI's suggestion should now consider the current roll number (1, 2, or 3) and the player's current upper section score, in addition to the dice values and available categories.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **UI Changes ([`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)):**
            *   Add `cmbRollNumber` (ComboBox or NumericUpDown) for user to select the current roll number (1-3).
            *   Add `txtCurrentUpperScore` (TextBox) for user to input their current upper section total score.
        *   **Logic Changes ([`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0)):**
            *   `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click` to read values from `cmbRollNumber` and `txtCurrentUpperScore`.
            *   Pass these new values (`rollNumber`, `currentUpperScore`) to `compPlayer.DecideDiceToHold()`.
        *   **Logic Changes ([`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0)):**
            *   Modify `DecideDiceToHold` method signature to accept `int rollNumber` and `int currentUpperScore`.
            *   Update internal heuristic logic in `DecideDiceToHold` to utilize `rollNumber` and `currentUpperScore` for more intelligent hold decisions (e.g., prioritizing upper section completion if bonus is viable and roll number is low).
        *   **Logic Changes ([`ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs`](ComputerYacht/Yacht.cs:0)):**
            *   `SetManuallyEnteredDice` method likely requires no significant changes for this feature, as `rollNumber` is passed directly to the `Computer` AI by `frmMain.cs`.
    *   **Pseudocode:** Generated for `frmMain.cs`, `Computer.cs`, and `Yacht.cs` to reflect these enhancements.
    *   **Memory Bank Updates:**
        *   [`memory-bank/productContext.md`](memory-bank/productContext.md:0) updated to describe the enhanced feature and new UI controls.
        *   [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md:0) updated (this entry).

    *   **Details:**
        *   **[`ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.Designer.cs:0):** Added `cmbRollNumber` (ComboBox), `txtCurrentUpperScore` (TextBox), and associated labels. Adjusted layout.
        *   **[`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0):** Modified `DecideDiceToHold` signature to `(int[] currentDiceValues, int rollNumber, bool[] availableCategories, int currentUpperScore)`. Added logic to use `rollNumber` (always hold all on roll 3) and `currentUpperScore` (prioritize upper section if bonus is viable and score is not too high).
        *   **[`ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs`](ComputerYacht/frmMain.cs:0):**
            *   In `btnGetHoldSuggestion_Click`: Read `rollNumber` from `cmbRollNumber` and `currentUpperScore` from `txtCurrentUpperScore`. Added input validation for these new fields. Passed these values to `compPlayer.DecideDiceToHold()`.
            *   In `InitializeNewGame()`: Added logic to reset `cmbRollNumber` to "1" and `txtCurrentUpperScore` to "0".
    *   **Status:** Code implementation complete for all specified files.
* [2025-05-18 22:36:00] - [Code Task: Fix AI Straight Holding Logic]
    *   **Task:** Addressed a bug in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0) where the `DecideDiceToHold` method would suggest holding for Small or Large Straights even if those categories were no longer available.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Modified `DecideDiceToHold` in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:113) to check `availableCategories[Yacht.INDEX_LGESTRAIGHT]` before evaluating large straights.
        *   Modified `DecideDiceToHold` in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:120) to check `availableCategories[Yacht.INDEX_SMLSTRAIGHT]` before evaluating small straights.
    *   **Status:** Code changes applied and verified. Memory Bank updated.
* [2025-05-18 22:40:00] - [Code Task: Add Debug Logging to AI Straight Logic]
    *   **Task:** Added detailed `Console.WriteLine()` debug logging to `DecideDiceToHold` and related private helper methods (`IsSmallStraight`, `IsLargeStraight`, `MarkStraightDice`) in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0).
    *   **Details:** Logged method entries, key parameters (dice values, roll number, category availability, upper score), strategy evaluation steps, dice counts, specific logic for straights (availability checks, detection results), and final hold decisions.
    *   **Status:** Debug logging implemented in [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:0).
* [2025-05-18 22:48:00] - [Debug Status Update: Fix Confirmation] Applied fixes for CS1503 in `Computer.cs` by ensuring `Console.WriteLine` uses `string.Join` for array types and fixed CS0649 in `frmMain.cs` by initializing `currentPhase` at declaration.
* [2025-05-18 22:55:28] - [Debug Status Update: Applied Fix for CS1061 and CS1503] Added `using System.Linq;` to [`ComputerYacht/Computer.cs`](ComputerYacht/Computer.cs:2) to resolve CS1061. Verified that existing `Console.WriteLine` calls for arrays generally use `string.Join`, which should address CS1503 issues related to `Select` method on `diceCounts` and other array printing.
* [2025-05-18 22:59:32] - [Debug Status Update: Cleaned Computer.cs, removed BOM]
* [2025-05-18 23:05:43] - [Code Task Completion: Updated .NET Framework Version] Modified [`ComputerYacht/ComputerYacht.csproj`](ComputerYacht/ComputerYacht.csproj:0) to target .NET Framework v4.0 (from v2.0) and added a reference to `System.Core.dll` to resolve CS0234 compilation error (System.Linq not found).
